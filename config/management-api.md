# Management API

You can manage PowerShell Universal using the built in Management API. It provides the ability to perform all the actions as the admin console in an automated manner. You can view and test the API by visiting the Swagger API documentation at it's default location on your machine `http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html` . 

## PowerShell Module

We provide a PowerShell module that calls the API on your behalf so you do not have to write the HTTP requests yourself. You can download this module from the PowerShell Gallery.
