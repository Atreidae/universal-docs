# Schedules

Schedules can be assigned to scripts and allow you to define frequency and other parameters for a script such as run as credentials. 

## Scheduling a Job 

To schedule a job, you can do so from the Automation / Schedules page and by clicking the New Schedule button. You can also schedule a script by click the Schedule option from the script's page. 

Schedules can be defined based on simple selections like Every Minute or Every Hour or you can define CRON expressions yourself for more configurable schedules. You can also run One Time schedules that run once at a later date. 

You can also define which user the scheduled job will run under as well as which PowerShell version to use.
