# Switch

Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.

Switches are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state itâ€™s in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

## Switch

```text
New-UDSwitch -Checked $true 
New-UDSwitch -Checked $true -Disabled
```

## OnChange Event

```text
New-UDSwitch -OnChange { Show-UDToast -Message $Body }
```
