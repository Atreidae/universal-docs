# Components

Components are pluggable widgets that can be added to Universal Dashboard. There are two components that are built in to PSU. These include the Nivo charts library as well as the UDMap component. Additional components can be downloaded from the [UD Marketplace](https://marketplace.universaldashboard.io/).
